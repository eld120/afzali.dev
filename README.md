### Getting Started

- If you'd like to run the site locally go ahead and clone it: `git clone git@github.com:eld120/afzali.dev.git`
- Install the dependencies: `npm install`
- On *nix sites run `./start`
- On Windows Powershell run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process | ./start.ps1`
- Your ability to execute powershell scripts on a locked down/work computer may vary, when all else fails run the following:
    - `npm start`
    - `sass --watch ./src/static/css/styles.sass ./src/static/css/styles.css`
